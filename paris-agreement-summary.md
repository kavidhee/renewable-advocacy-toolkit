# Paris Agreement Summary

## Main Goal

The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), aims to strengthen the global response to climate change by:

* Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
* Increasing the ability of countries to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development.
* Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.

## Key Mechanisms

* **Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs):** Each country sets its own emission reduction targets and plans, which are updated every five years with increased ambition.
* **Global Stocktake:** Every five years, the collective progress toward the Agreement's goals is assessed, informing the next round of NDCs.
* **Transparency Framework:** A system for monitoring and reporting progress, ensuring accountability.
* **Finance, Technology, and Capacity-Building Support:** Developed countries are to provide financial resources to assist developing countries with mitigation and adaptation efforts.

## Significance for Renewable Energy Advocacy

The Paris Agreement provides a global political mandate that underscores the urgency of transitioning away from fossil fuels and scaling up renewable energy. The 1.5°C limit in particular requires rapid decarbonization of the energy sector, making the Agreement a crucial reference point for advocating stronger renewable energy policies and investments.
