# Key Facts on Climate Change and Renewable Energy

## Impact of Fossil Fuels

* Fossil fuels are the primary source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for over 75% of global CO₂ emissions.
* Burning coal, oil, and natural gas releases not only CO₂ but also air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, leading to respiratory illnesses and premature deaths.
* Extraction and transportation of fossil fuels cause habitat destruction, water pollution, and risks of spills and leaks.
* The energy sector is responsible for about 40% of global methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas with more than 80 times the warming power of CO₂ over 20 years.
* Reliance on fossil fuels creates geopolitical tensions and price volatility, affecting energy security.

## Benefits of Renewable Energy

* Renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biomass) produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions during operation.
* Solar and wind power have seen dramatic cost reductions over the past decade, making them the cheapest sources of new electricity generation in many parts of the world.
* Renewable energy systems can be deployed in a distributed manner, increasing energy access for remote communities and enhancing grid resilience.
* Transitioning to renewables reduces air pollution, which could prevent millions of premature deaths annually and lower healthcare costs.
* Renewable energy creates more jobs per unit of electricity generated than fossil fuels, supporting local economies.
* Unlike finite fossil fuels, renewables are inexhaustible and reduce dependence on imported fuels, boosting energy independence.
